Yesterday I added in the final parts from the tutorial: mipmapping and multisampling. I think the best way to really test it and see it in action would be to add some controls. A quick way would be to poll key events, but the cooler way would be to add ImGui.

It looks like there are a few posts out there that go into integrating ImGui. I thought it was going to be a straightforward plug and chug library, but it is way more involved that I thought.

A really really really stupid mistake: Tried to include the files without adding them to visual studio. :upside_down_smiley:

Based on the SaschaWillems sample, he created a new class for ImGui that also has the Vulkan rendering contexts.
